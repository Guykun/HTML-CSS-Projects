          League of Legends is a popular MOBA with a generalized set of rules.
          Which can be used to be manipulated into making your own team
          strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
          This page will help cover the overall idea of different roles within
          the game. To potentially assist teaching someone new, or brushing up
          on information.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="The_Basics">

        <p>
          The game is broken down into a couple of phases in order to build up
          to the main objective of the game; destroying the enemy nexus.
        </p>
        <p>The phases are the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Laning</li>
          <li>Mid Game</li>
          <li>Late Game</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each of these phases have their own complexities, which are important
          to understand so you can make the best move at the right time. Every
          champion has different pro's and con's to weigh, and will affect how
          those phases will go. There is a number of objectives that are
          required to win. As well as objectives to strengthen your team
          overall.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Laning_Phase">
        <header>Laning Phase</header>
        <p>
          Laning phase is the beginning of the game. Everyone will be sorting
          into their designated positions. Minions will spawn and be the main
          source of income for gold and exp. Each one you kill grants you extra
          gold. It is very important to get as many as you can to be able to buy
          items for better stats.
        </p>
        <p>
          In order to gain a lead, you should try and influence your opponent to
          leave or stand back. To do this you have to "poke" them or receive a
          "gank" from another player on your team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Poking is when you damage the other player without trying to fully
          commit to a head on fight. Kind of like a warning shot.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ganks are when another player assists you in your lane to surprise the
          enemy and force a committed fight. If the opponent survives; you
          hopefully forced them to expend some of their defensive resources, or
          got them to leave.
        </p>
        <code
          >It is popular in average or higher skill level players to start off a
          game by hiding together in order to catch someone by surprise for an
          early lead. This happens before the minions spawn.</code
        >
        <p>
          Doing all of this is so you can push your lane safely and take down
          the opposing enemy tower. This will open up more space on the enemy
          side and get you closer to their nexus.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="Mid_Game">
        <header>Mid Game</header>
        <p>
          Mid game will start to happen around the time that laners have taken a
          tower or two and jungle objectives start spawning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Towers are what the laner's main objectives are. Every lane contains 3
          towers heading toward the base on either side, with each tower
          stronger than the last.
        </p>
        <p>Here's a list of the structures in order, front to back:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>1st Tier Tower</li>
          <li>2nd Tier Tower</li>
          <li>3rd Tier Tower</li>
          <li>Inhibitor</li>
          <li>2 Nexus Towers</li>
          <li>Nexus</li>
        </ul>
        <code
          >The strength of the structures remains true from front to back with
          the exception of 1st Tier Tower within 14 minutes of starting the
          game. During 0-14min it has bonus armor to prevent certain unfair
          strategies from ending the game incredibly fast.</code
        >
        <p>
          The timing of mid game can vary based on the situation. Often its
          around the 12min mark. This is when people will start roaming from
          their lanes, teamfighting, gathering for jungle objectives/taking a
          tower together. Making decisions to gain control of the map, hinder
          the enemy, or just out-right beat them is done during this time.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time goes on, and based on the opposing enemy strength; will
          determine how safe it is to be alone. Some champions thrive on being
          alone for most of the game. A larger portion of them do not.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="End_Game">
        <header>End Game</header>
        <p>
          End game is very intense and has room for little mistakes. At this
          time normally a base has lost an inhibitor and champions are around
          level 14+. Teams will be looking to catch people who are alone to make
          a teamfight more in their favor/gaining an objective easier.
        </p>
        <p>
          One successful team fight is all it takes for a game to end or to
          completely turn the tides. The time players remain dead is a lot
          longer. Meaning lots of uninterrupted time to remove structures, gain
          jungle objectives, or prepare the map so you may have one more
          successful fight to win.
        </p>
        <code
          >Sometimes a team will "backdoor", which is a strategy where they try
          to sneak around the enemy in order to destroy the nexus.</code

      <section class="main-section" id="Roles">
        <header>Roles</header>
        <p>
          Let's talk about roles. Champions have uniques roles and can be
          flexible with them as well based on how they are statistically built
          or played. Those roles have general asigned lanes as well. Keeping it
          simple, here are the lane's with their general champion roles:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Top Lane
            <p>-Tanks</p>
            <p>-Fighters</p>
            <code
              >Some marksmen go top as well but not enough of them to make it
              the main focus. This also affects the team's balance</code
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Jungler
            <p>-Assassins</p>
            <p>-Fighters</p>
            <code
              >This role can vary a lot. Mages make their way in often, but this
              also affects the team's balance since the jungle objectives will
              be harder to obtain alone.</code
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Mid Lane
            <p>-Mages</p>
            <p>-Assassins</p>
            <code
              >People who can roam quickly from their lane can also be suitable
              here. Usually they only run to Bot lane for some quick
              money.</code
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bot Lane (ADC)
            <p>-Marksmen</p>
            <code
              >Mages can be a popular pick instead of a Marksmen. Theres usually
              a select few that make an appearance. People will refer to it as
              an APC.</code
            >
          </li>
          <br />
          <li>
            Bot Lane (Support)
            <p>-Healers</p>
            <p>-Tanks</p>
            <p>-Mage</p>
            <code
              >Since this is a 2v2 lane a lot of people test out combinations.
              Support tends to see a lot of variables. Pro's have a habit of
              causing a trend of new combos. Usually aren't beginner friendly
              idea's.</code
            >
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Player's tend to find a role or 2 that they are very comfortable in
          and focus on those champions. Its best to find who you feel
          comfortable playing before really getting into all the details.
